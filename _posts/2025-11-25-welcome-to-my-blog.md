## Hello World! 👋

Welcome to my blog! I'm Okan Kurnaz, a Senior Data Engineer with over 9 years of experience in building scalable data platforms.

## Why This Blog?

Throughout my career, I've worked across various industries—finance, gaming, e-commerce, and hospitality—and I've learned a lot about:

- Building modern data architectures (warehouses, lakes, and lakehouses)
- Real-time streaming with Kafka and Spark
- Data quality and governance
- Cloud technologies (AWS and GCP)
- Self-service analytics platforms

This blog is my space to share what I've learned, document interesting problems I've solved, and contribute back to the data engineering community.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Technical Deep Dives**: Architecture patterns, performance optimization, and hands-on tutorials
- **Tools & Technologies**: My experiences with Spark, Kafka, Airflow, dbt, and cloud platforms
- **Best Practices**: Data modeling, data quality, governance, and observability
- **Career Insights**: Lessons learned from working in different industries and teams

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow data engineers and tech enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/okankurnaz) or [GitHub](https://github.com/kurnazokan).

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
